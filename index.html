                <p>Hello! I'm Simon, I'm an aspiring developer, and this is my portfolio. </p>
                <p>My undergraduate degree was in Psychology, but while undertaking it, I learned Python in order to develop simple data-capturing programmes for use in Psychological experiments. I soon found developing these tools more compelling than the nature of the research itself.</p>
                <p>After graduating, I decided not to continue in academia, and instead tried my hand at a range of vocations, including gardener, carer and administrator. The positive outcome of this time was that I met my partner and moved to Sheffield.</p>
                <p>I currently co-organise <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CodeUp-Sheffield/" title="CodeUp Sheffield group on meetup.com">CodeUp Sheffield</a>, and I am about to start the Northcoders 12-week bootcamp in Leeds. In preparation, I am learning JavaScript and building this website. At the end of it, I hope to find employment as a developer in my beloved city of Sheffield.</p>
